# agent-engine-runner-shared

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The Python runner runtime for Atlas Agent Engine. It provides the platform
protocol, secure tool and LLM wrappers, request-scoped runtime context, and
server adapters used by the Python LangGraph and ADK SDKs.

This package is an open-source runtime integration library. Running an agent
through the managed service requires Atlas Agent Engine services such as the
Orchestration Engine and the Agent Execution Runtime; those services are not
distributed with this package. Agent authors normally depend on a framework SDK
(`agent-engine-sdk-langgraph` or `agent-engine-sdk-adk`), which installs this
package.
